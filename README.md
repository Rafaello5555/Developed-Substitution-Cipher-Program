# Developed-Substitution-Cipher-Program
The created program perform   encrypting the  message and decrypting  message by using substitution cipher . The program ask user to enter secret message and  encrypt this message by using substitution cipher and display the encrypted message. Then decrypt  encrypted message back to the original message. We need to iterate through the secret message one character at a time.  I have used range-based for Loop and every character sees the secret mesagge  in the loop. In the loop 
I have access to see which represents current  character, I am looking at in my secret mesagge . We call 'find' method to see character position . If it finds it, 
we substitute with equivalent character at  same position and key, if it doesnt find it, we are processing that character as is, so we are not substitute it.
